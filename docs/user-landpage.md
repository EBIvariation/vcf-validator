The VCF Validation Suite is a set of programs that you can download and **execute in your computer** using a terminal (called "[command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe)" on Windows, and "terminal" or "console" in Linux and macOS).

You can download all programs (`vcf_validator` and `vcf_assembly_checker`) from [the releases page](https://github.com/EBIvariation/vcf-validator/releases). Note that the tools are available for Linux, macOS and Windows.

You may particularly be interested in the `vcf_validator` which checks compliance with the [VCF specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf).

Read the [README.md](https://github.com/EBIvariation/vcf-validator/blob/master/README.md#run) for the instructions on how to run these tools. Running the tools with `--help` will also briefly explain the available parameters.
